## Characteristics of Oriented Programming

· Emphasis is on data rather than procedure.

· Programs are divided into what are known as objects.

· Data structures are designed such that they characterize the objects.

· Functions that operate on the data of an object are tied together in the data structure.

· Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions.

· Objects may communicate with each other through functions.

· New data and functions can be easily added whenever necessary.

· Follows bottom-up approach in program design.
