# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS

## Objectives

> - Introduction to object oriented programming

> - Benefits of OOPS
 
> - Applications of OOPS
## Characteristics of Oriented Programming


  1.Programs are divided into what are known as objects.

  2.Data structures are designed such that they characterize the objects.

  3.Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions.

  4.Objects may communicate with each other through functions.

  5.New data and functions can be easily added whenever necessary.

  6.Follows bottom-up approach in program design.

## Definition

  “Object-oriented programming as an approach that provides a way of
  modularizing programs by creating partitioned memory area for both data and functions that
  can be used as templates for creating copies of such modules on demand.”
  Thus, an object is considered to be partitioned area of computer memory that stores
  data and set of operations that can access that data. 
  
## Basic Concepts of Object-oriented Programming

  It is necessary to understand some of the concepts used extensively in object-oriented
  programming. They are:
 
> - Objects
> - Classes
> - Data abstraction and encapsulation
> - Inheritance
> - Polymorphism
> - Dynamic binding
> - Message passing
