## Characteristics of Oriented Programming


1.Programs are divided into what are known as objects.

2.Data structures are designed such that they characterize the objects.

3.Functions that operate on the data of an object are tied together in the data structure.

4.Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions.

5.Objects may communicate with each other through functions.

6.New data and functions can be easily added whenever necessary.

7.Follows bottom-up approach in program design.
